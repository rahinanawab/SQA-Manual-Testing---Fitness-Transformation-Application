# SQA-Manual-Testing---Fitness-Transformation-Application

Manual testing is the process of evaluating software for defects by hand. It requires the tester to assume the role of an end user, utilizing most of the application's features to confirm that they work correctly.

Fitness transformation refers to the process of achieving significant physical and health changes through structured exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle adjustments. It involves setting specific fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or improved endurance, and implementing a tailored workout and diet plan to reach those goals. This journey not only enhances physical appearance but also promotes overall well-being and self-confidence.

The test cases and bug reports have been attached.
